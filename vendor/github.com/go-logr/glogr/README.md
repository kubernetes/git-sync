# Minimal Go logging using glog

This package implements the [logr interface](https://github.com/thockin/logr)
in terms of Google's [glog](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/glog).  This
provides a relatively minimalist API to logging in Go, backed by a well-proven
implementation.

This is a BETA grade implementation.
