# HOW TO USE THIS CONTAINER:
#
# The only commandline argument (or env var) that is really required is
# `--repo` ($GITSYNC_REPO).  Everything else is optional (run this with
# `--man` for details).
#
# This container will run as UID:GID 65533:65533 by default.  For most users,
# the simplest ways to use this container are either:
#   a) use the default UID/GID and mount a volume on /git writeable by those
#   b) set your own UID/GID and mount a volume on /git writeable by those
#
# If you mount a volume anywhere else, you must set `--root` ($GITSYNC_ROOT).
# If you do not mount a volume, this will run but you can't access the results
# (which might be useful for testing, but not much else).
#
# Newly created docker volumes (the very first `docker run -v`) are initialized
# based on the in-image mountpoint's UID/GID?mode, so another solution for
# using this with docker is to set your own UID/GID and also add the default
# GID as a supplemental group (see `docker run --group-add`).
#
# Kubernetes offers `Pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup` to manage volume
# permissions.
#
# If you set any UID other than the default and want to use git over SSH, you
# should set `--add-user` ($GITSYNC_ADD_USER).
