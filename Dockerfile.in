# HOW TO USE THIS CONTAINER:
#
# For most users, the simplest way to use this container is to mount a volume
# on /git.  The only commandline argument (or env var) that is really required
# is `--repo` ($GIT_SYNC_REPO).  Everything else is optional (run this with
# `--man` for details).
#
# This container will run as UID:GID 65533:65533 by default, and unless you
# change that, you do not need to think about permissions much.  If you run
# into permissions problems, this might help:
#
#  - User does not mount a volume
#    => should work, but limited utility
#
#  - User mounts a new docker volume on /git
#    => should work
#
#  - User mounts an existing docker volume on /git
#    => if the volume already exists with compatible permissions it should work
#    => if the volume already exists with different permissions you can either
#       set the container UID or GID(s) or you can chown the volume
#
#  - User mounts an existing dir on /git
#    => set container UID or GID(s) to be able to access that dir
#
#  - User sets a different UID and git-sync GID
#    => should work
#
#  - User sets a different GID
#    => either add the git-sync GID or else set --root, mount a volume,
#       and manage volume permissions to access that volume
