# NOTE: THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

This document is the "master" branch, which is under active development.  If
you are looking for docs on released versions of git-sync, you probably want to
use the [v3.x branch](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/tree/release-3.x).

# git-sync

git-sync is a simple command that pulls a git repository into a local directory.
It is a perfect "sidecar" container in Kubernetes - it can periodically pull
files down from a repository so that an application can consume them.

git-sync can pull one time, or on a regular interval.  It can pull from the
HEAD of a branch, from a git tag, or from a specific git hash.  It will only
re-pull if the target of the run has changed in the upstream repository.  When
it re-pulls, it updates the destination directory atomically.  In order to do
this, it uses a git worktree in a subdirectory of the `--root` and flips a
symlink.

git-sync can pull over HTTP(S) (with authentication or not) or SSH.

git-sync can also be configured to make a webhook call upon successful git repo
synchronization. The call is made after the symlink is updated.

## Building it

We use [docker buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx) to build images.

```
# build the container
make container REGISTRY=registry VERSION=tag
```

```
# build the container behind a proxy
make container REGISTRY=registry VERSION=tag \
    HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy_address>:<proxy_port> \
    HTTPS_PROXY=https://<proxy_address>:<proxy_port>
```

```
# build the container for an OS/arch other than the current (e.g. you are on
# MacOS and want to run on Linux)
make container REGISTRY=registry VERSION=tag \
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64
```

## Usage

```
# make a directory (owned by you) for the volume
export DIR="/tmp/git-data"
mkdir -p $DIR

# run the container (as your own UID)

# run the container
docker run -d \
    -v $DIR:/tmp/git \
    -u$(id -u):$(id -g) \
    registry/git-sync:tag \
        --repo=https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync \
        --root=/tmp/git/root \
        --period=30s

# run an nginx container to serve the content
docker run -d \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -v $DIR:/usr/share/nginx/html \
    nginx
```

### Volumes

The `--root` flag must indicate either a directory that either a) does not
exist (it will be created); or b) exists and is empty; or c) can be emptied by
removing all of the contents.

Why?  Git demands to clone into an empty directory.  If the directory exists
and is not empty, git-sync will try to empty it by removing everything in it
(we can't just `rm -rf` the dir because it might be a mounted volume).  If that
fails, git-sync will abort.

With the above example or with a Kubernetes `emptyDir`, there is usually no
problem.  The problematic case is when the volume is the root of a filesystem,
which sometimes contains metadata (e.g. ext{2,3,4} have a `lost+found` dir).
Git will not clone into such a directory (`fatal: destination path
'/tmp/git-data' already exists and is not an empty directory`).  The only real
solution is to use a sub-directory of the volume as the `--root`.

GIT-SYNC

NAME
    git-sync - sync a remote git repository

SYNOPSIS
    git-sync --repo=<repo> [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION

    Fetch a remote git repository to a local directory, poll the remote for
    changes, and update the local copy.

    This is a perfect "sidecar" container in Kubernetes.  For example, it can
    periodically pull files down from a repository so that an application can
    consume them.

    git-sync can pull one time, or on a regular interval.  It can read from the
    HEAD of a branch, from a git tag, or from a specific git hash.  It will only
    re-pull if the target has changed in the remote repository.  When it
    re-pulls, it updates the destination directory atomically.  In order to do
    this, it uses a git worktree in a subdirectory of the --root and flips a
    symlink.

    git-sync can pull over HTTP(S) (with authentication or not) or SSH.

    git-sync can also be configured to make a webhook call upon successful git
    repo synchronization.  The call is made after the symlink is updated.

OPTIONS

    Many options can be specified as either a commandline flag or an environment
    variable.

    --add-user, $GIT_SYNC_ADD_USER
            Add a record to /etc/passwd for the current UID/GID.  This is
            needed to use SSH with an arbitrary UID (see --ssh).  This assumes
            that /etc/passwd is writable by the current UID.

    --askpass-url <string>, $GIT_SYNC_ASKPASS_URL
            A URL to query for git credentials.  The query must return success
            (200) and produce a series of key=value lines, including
            "username=<value>" and "password=<value>".

    --branch <string>, $GIT_SYNC_BRANCH
            The git branch to check out.  If not specified, this defaults to
            the default branch of --repo.

    --change-permissions <int>, $GIT_SYNC_PERMISSIONS
            Change permissions on the checked-out files to the specified mode.

    --cookie-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_COOKIE_FILE
            Use a git cookiefile (/etc/git-secret/cookie_file) for
            authentication.

    --depth <int>, $GIT_SYNC_DEPTH
            Create a shallow clone with history truncated to the specified
            number of commits.  If not specified, this defaults to cloning the
            full history of the repo.

    --error-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_ERROR_FILE
            The path to an optional file into which errors will be written.
            This may be an absolute path or a relative path, in which case it
            is relative to --root.  If it is relative to --root, the first path
            element may not start with a period.

    --exechook-backoff <duration>, $GIT_SYNC_EXECHOOK_BACKOFF
            The time to wait before retrying a failed --exechook-command.  If
            not specified, this defaults to 3 seconds ("3s").

    --exechook-command <string>, $GIT_SYNC_EXECHOOK_COMMAND
            An optional command to be executed after syncing a new hash of the
            remote repository.  This command does not take any arguments and
            executes with the synced repo as its working directory.  The
            environment variable $GITSYNC_HASH will be set to the git SHA that
            was synced.  The execution is subject to the overall --sync-timeout
            flag and will extend the effective period between sync attempts.
            This flag obsoletes --sync-hook-command, but if sync-hook-command
            is specified, it will take precedence.

    --exechook-timeout <duration>, $GIT_SYNC_EXECHOOK_TIMEOUT
            The timeout for the --exechook-command.  If not specifid, this
            defaults to 30 seconds ("30s").

    --git <string>, $GIT_SYNC_GIT
            The git command to run (subject to PATH search, mostly for
            testing).  This defaults to "git".

    --git-config <string>, $GIT_SYNC_GIT_CONFIG
            Additional git config options in 'key1:val1,key2:val2' format.  The
            key parts are passed to 'git config' and must be valid syntax for
            that command.  The val parts can be either quoted or unquoted
            values.  For all values the following escape sequences are
            supported: '\n' => [newline], '\t' => [tab], '\"' => '"', '\,' =>
            ',', '\\' => '\'.  Within unquoted values, commas MUST be escaped.
            Within quoted values, commas MAY be escaped, but are not required
            to be.  Any other escape sequence is an error.

    --git-gc <string>, $GIT_SYNC_GIT_GC
            The git garbage collection behavior: one of "auto", "always",
            "aggressive", or "off".  If not specified, this defaults to
            "auto".

            - auto: Run "git gc --auto" once per successful sync.  This mode
              respects git's gc.* config params.
            - always: Run "git gc" once per successful sync.
            - aggressive: Run "git gc --aggressive" once per successful sync.
              This mode can be slow and may require a longer --sync-timeout value.
            - off: Disable explicit git garbage collection, which may be a good
              fit when also using --one-time.

    -h, --help
            Print help text and exit.

    --http-bind <string>, $GIT_SYNC_HTTP_BIND
            The bind address (including port) for git-sync's HTTP endpoint.  If
            not specified, the HTTP endpoint is not enabled.

    --http-metrics, $GIT_SYNC_HTTP_METRICS
            Enable metrics on git-sync's HTTP endpoint, if it is enabled (see
            --http-bind).

    --http-pprof, $GIT_SYNC_HTTP_PPROF
            Enable the pprof debug endpoints on git-sync's HTTP endpoint, if it
            is enabled (see --http-bind).

    --link <string>, $GIT_SYNC_LINK
            The path to at which to create a symlink which points to the
            current git directory, at the currently synced SHA.  This may be an
            absolute path or a relative path, in which case it is relative to
            --root.  The last path element is the name of the link and must not
            start with a period.  Consumers of the synced files should always
            use this link - it is updated atomically and should always be
            valid.  The basename of the target of the link is the current SHA.
            If not specified, this defaults to the leaf dir of --repo.

    --man
            Print this manual and exit.

    --max-failures <int>, $GIT_SYNC_MAX_FAILURES
            The number of consecutive failures allowed before aborting (the
            first sync must succeed), Setting this to a negative value will
            retry forever after the initial sync.  If not specified, this
            defaults to 0, meaning any sync failure will terminate git-sync.

    --one-time, $GIT_SYNC_ONE_TIME
            Exit after one sync.

    --password <string>, $GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD
            The password or personal access token (see github docs) to use for
            git authentication (see --username).  NOTE: for security reasons,
            users should prefer --password-file or $GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD_FILE for
            specifying the password.

    --password-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD_FILE
            The file from which the password or personal access token (see
            github docs) to use for git authentication (see --username) will be
            read.

    --period <duration>, $GIT_SYNC_PERIOD
            How long to wait between sync attempts.  This must be at least
            10ms.  This flag obsoletes --wait, but if --wait is specified, it
            will take precedence.  If not specified, this defaults to 10
            seconds ("10s").

    --repo <string>, $GIT_SYNC_REPO
            The git repository to sync.  This flag is required.

    --rev <string>, $GIT_SYNC_REV
            The git revision (tag or hash) to check out.  If not specified,
            this defaults to "HEAD".

    --root <string>, $GIT_SYNC_ROOT
            The root directory for git-sync operations, under which --link will
            be created.  This must be a path that either a) does not exist (it
            will be created); b) is an empty directory; or c) is a directory
            which can be emptied by removing all of the contents.  This flag is
            required.

    --sparse-checkout-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_SPARSE_CHECKOUT_FILE
            The path to a git sparse-checkout file (see git documentation for
            details) which controls which files and directories will be checked
            out.  If not specified, the default is to check out the entire repo.

    --ssh, $GIT_SYNC_SSH
            Use SSH for git authentication and operations.

    --ssh-key-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_SSH_KEY_FILE
            The SSH key to use when using --ssh.  If not specified, this
            defaults to "/etc/git-secret/ssh".

    --ssh-known-hosts, $GIT_SYNC_KNOWN_HOSTS
            Enable SSH known_hosts verification when using --ssh.  If not
            specified, this defaults to true.

    --ssh-known-hosts-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE
            The known_hosts file to use when --ssh-known-hosts is specified.
            If not specified, this defaults to "/etc/git-secret/known_hosts".

    --submodules <string>, $GIT_SYNC_SUBMODULES
            The git submodule behavior: one of "recursive", "shallow", or
            "off".  If not specified, this defaults to "recursive".

    --sync-timeout <duration>, $GIT_SYNC_SYNC_TIMEOUT
            The total time allowed for one complete sync.  This must be at least
            10ms.  This flag obsoletes --timeout, but if --timeout is specified,
            it will take precedence.  If not specified, this defaults to 120
            seconds ("120s").

    --touch-file <string>, $GIT_SYNC_TOUCH_FILE
            The path to an optional file which will be touched whenever a sync
            completes.  This may be an absolute path or a relative path, in
            which case it is relative to --root.  If it is relative to --root,
            the first path element may not start with a period.

    --username <string>, $GIT_SYNC_USERNAME
            The username to use for git authentication (see --password-file or
            --password).

    -v, --verbose <int>
            Set the log verbosity level.  Logs at this level and lower will be
            printed.

    --version
            Print the version and exit.

    --webhook-backoff <duration>, $GIT_SYNC_WEBHOOK_BACKOFF
            The time to wait before retrying a failed --webhook-url.  If not
            specified, this defaults to 3 seconds ("3s").

    --webhook-method <string>, $GIT_SYNC_WEBHOOK_METHOD
            The HTTP method for the --webhook-url.  If not specified, this defaults to "POST".

    --webhook-success-status <int>, $GIT_SYNC_WEBHOOK_SUCCESS_STATUS
            The HTTP status code indicating a successful --webhook-url.  Setting
            this to -1 disables success checks to make webhooks
            "fire-and-forget".  If not specified, this defaults to 200.

    --webhook-timeout <duration>, $GIT_SYNC_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT
            The timeout for the --webhook-url.  If not specified, this defaults
            to 1 second ("1s").

    --webhook-url <string>, $GIT_SYNC_WEBHOOK_URL
            A URL for optional webhook notifications when syncs complete.  The
            header 'Gitsync-Hash' will be set to the git SHA that was synced.

EXAMPLE USAGE

    git-sync \
        --repo=https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync \
        --branch=main \
        --rev=HEAD \
        --period=10s \
        --root=/mnt/git

AUTHENTICATION

    Git-sync offers several authentication options to choose from.  If none of
    the following are specified, git-sync will try to access the repo in the
    "natural" manner.  For example, "https://repo" will try to use plain HTTPS
    and "git@example.com:repo" will try to use SSH.

    username/password
            The --username (GIT_SYNC_USERNAME) and --password-file
            (GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD_FILE) or --password (GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD) flags
            will be used.  To prevent password leaks, the --password-file flag
            or GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD environment variable is almost always
            preferred to the --password flag.

            A variant of this is --askpass-url (GIT_SYNC_ASKPASS_URL), which
            consults a URL (e.g. http://metadata) to get credentials on each
            sync.

    SSH
            When --ssh (GIT_SYNC_SSH) is specified, the --ssh-key-file
            (GIT_SYNC_SSH_KEY_FILE) will be used.  Users are strongly advised
            to also use --ssh-known-hosts (GIT_SYNC_KNOWN_HOSTS) and
            --ssh-known-hosts-file (GIT_SYNC_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE) when using
            SSH.

    cookies
            When --cookie-file (GIT_SYNC_COOKIE_FILE) is specified, the
            associated cookies can contain authentication information.

HOOKS

    Webhooks and exechooks are executed asynchronously from the main git-sync
    process.  If a --webhook-url or --exechook-command is configured, whenever
    a new hash is synced the hook(s) will be invoked.  For exechook, that means
    the command is exec()'ed, and for webhooks that means an HTTP request is
    sent using the method defined in --webhook-method.  Git-sync will retry
    both forms of hooks until they succeed (exit code 0 for exechooks, or
    --webhook-success-status for webhooks).  If unsuccessful, git-sync will
    wait --exechook-backoff or --webhook-backoff (as appropriate) before
    re-trying the hook.

    Hooks are not guaranteed to succeed on every single SHA change.  For example,
    if a hook fails and a new SHA is synced during the backoff period, the
    retried hook will fire for the newest SHA.
